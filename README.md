# Investment Calculator

This is an Investment Calculator web application created during my React learning journey. The app allows users to input their initial investment, annual contributions, expected return rate, and investment duration to calculate and visualize the growth of their investment over time.

## Features

- Input fields for initial investment, annual investment, expected return, and duration.
- Dynamic calculation of investment growth year by year.
- Displays results in a clear, tabular format.
